# Generational
Generational is a collaborative, web-based memory book application that gives you specific prompts to write and reflect on. It takes away the stress of thinking of what to write and allows you to spend more time actually writing. Instead of having to buy the whole book, you can purchase and download the entries you've written, so there's never any pressure to fully complete a giant, daunting book; it's complete whenever you feel it is!
